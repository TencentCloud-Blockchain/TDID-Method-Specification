# TDID-Method-Specification

## Abstract

[TencentCloud Decentralized Identity (TDID)](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/tdid)  provides infrastructure for cross-system and cross-organization trusted digital identity and data exchange services. TDID is based on the blockchain and provides a distributed mechanism for generating, holding and verifying identity identifiers DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials) that carry identity data, enabling you to encrypt security, protect Data privacy and machine-verifiable third-party representation of various types of real-world identities and credentials on the Internet.

## Introduction

Tencent Cloud Blockchain, as China's leading blockchain service platform and technology provider, is committed to building a blockchain infrastructure for technology, data, value, and industrial interconnection, leading blockchain underlying technology and industry application innovation, assisting the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, and promoting the deep integration of the real economy and the digital economy.

Tencent Cloud Decentralized Identity (TDID) is a set of digital identity basic services built on the Tencent Cloud blockchain TBaaS platform, which is full-featured and easy to use. TDID provides a mechanism for the distributed generation and verification of globally unique identifiers (Decentralized Identifiers, DIDs) to identify various entities (people, institutions, objects, etc.). At the same time, various types of credentials (Verifiable Credentials, VCs) in the real society are expressed on the network by means of encryption security, privacy protection, and machine verification by a third party, so as to provide cross-organization and cross-regional trust between entities. Provides infrastructure for digital identities, digital credentials and data exchange.

## Features
### Distributed ID Registration

The distributed and multi-centralized ID registration mechanism based on blockchain gets rid of the dependence on the single-center ID registration in the traditional mode. It gives entities (people, institutions, things, etc.) the ability to independently control identity control, and provides basic functions such as entity identity creation, update, and verification.

### Distributed issuance/validation

Issuers of various identities/credentials issue data-bearing certificates to entities, and verifiers can verify the entity's identity control right on the blockchain, and further verify the authenticity, integrity, and authority of its identity/credential data.
